                <h3> GOOD TO USE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS </h3>
                <p> I am skilled in using software applications because I have learned from school. 
                    So, when I entered UITM, I was able to apply my skills in software when doing assignments.</p>

                <h3> DOING WELL IN COMMUNICATIONS </h3>
                <p>I am good at communicating with others. I am also a friendly person and easy to adapt with new people. 
                    When the person speaks, I will look the person in the eye and try to be a good listener. </p>

                <h3> Can work in a group</h3>
                <p> I prefer working in a group than working alone. For me when working in a group, I can help my group 
                    mates and pour out ideas to help the group. Not only that, I can also strengthen the relationship 
                    between group mates.</p>
